"""The glue that pairs any frontend with any bar-pointer model (BPM).

Every rung of the ladder is a bar-pointer model -- whatever its machinery (handcrafted HMM,
learned factors, CVAE), it models the latent bar-pointer state (phase, tempo, meter) and reads
beats off its trajectory. That, not the inference engine, is the component-role name; "rung"
stays the ladder-position name. Spelled out as bar_pointer in code because the acronym BPM
collides with beats-per-minute (min_bpm/max_bpm below).

Sits above both packages: frontends/ knows nothing about bar-pointer models, rungs/ knows
nothing about audio. This is the composition surface: frontends resolve by dotted module path
(`frontends.beat_this` -- no registry to edit when adding one), bar-pointer models by the
BAR_POINTERS registry (the ladder is small and central), so a config can say
`frontend: frontends.beat_this, bar_pointer: 2016_dbn` and this file resolves both. The Tracker is the whole plug-and-play story: it wires the frontend's fps into the model's
constructor (a wrong fps mis-scales every tempo grid -- fps is a property OF THE ACTIVATIONS,
never a constant) and converts the activation form once.
