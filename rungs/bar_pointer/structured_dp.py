"""Structured DP for the Krebs bar-pointer: O(num_states + beats_per_bar * num_tempi^2) per frame
instead of O(num_states^2).

The transition is not a general matrix. It is exactly two things (Krebs 2015):
  * inside a tempo's block, a DETERMINISTIC +1 advance                    -> a gather
  * at beat boundaries only, a tempo mix (last_states of beat b-1 -> first_states of beat b),
    with madmom's exponential_transition                                  -> one [num_tempi, num_tempi]
                                                                            logsumexp
So we never materialize [num_states, num_states]. Measured at our real num_states=16756 (4/4,
86.13 fps, num_tempi=71):

    dense       1.12 GB, K^2       = 280,763,536 ops/frame   -> 4.4 trillion ops per 3-min song
    structured  no matrix, K+M*V^2 =      36,920 ops/frame   -> 7,605x less work

which is the difference between ~2 s and ~5-9 HOURS per song (hmmlearn/librosa, dense, both of which
agree with this code on 100% of frames at that size -- see rungs/bar_pointer/inference.py for the numbers).

Speed is NOT why this file exists: madmom's Cython HMM decodes the same topology in 1.04 s vs our
1.95 s. GRADIENTS are why. And our 1.9x deficit is not intrinsic -- viterbi costs a flat ~122
us/frame at num_states=952 and at num_states=16756 alike (17.6x the ops, 1.00x the time), so we are
bound by Python dispatch and kernel launches, not arithmetic.

This file exists because our topology is STRUCTURED, not merely sparse. A generic sparse HMM needs a
segment-max over each state's incoming arcs, and core PyTorch has no scatter_max -- pomegranate's
SparseHMM (which IS sparse and differentiable, and agrees with this code on 100% of frames) therefore
loops `for j in range(n_states)` per frame in Python and takes ~4.9 hours per song. Here the +1
advance makes the transition one gather plus one dense [M, V, V] max, so the segment-max never
arises. madmom's Cython HMM runs this topology fast but gives no gradient, which R2-R4 need.
See rungs/bar_pointer/inference.py for the full library comparison.

Certified against the dense DP in tests/test_structured_dp.py; the dense DP is itself certified
against hmmlearn and torch-struct. Chain of certificates.
