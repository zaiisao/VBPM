"""R0 -- Baseline A: the madmom bar-pointer DBN (Krebs/Boeck 2015).

Self-contained: it calls the official madmom DBNDownBeatTrackingProcessor directly and formats the
input with the standard decorrelation convention (Boeck et al.):

    decorrelated = [ max(beat - downbeat, floor),  downbeat ]

Why decorrelate: madmom's downbeat observation model computes the "no-beat" log-density as roughly
    log( (1 - (beat + downbeat)) / normalizer ),
so it assumes beat + downbeat <= 1. A neural frontend whose beat channel fires on every beat
(downbeats included) gives beat + downbeat ~ 2 at each downbeat -> log(negative), which madmom would
silently clamp. Decorrelating turns the two columns into a valid [P(beat-not-downbeat), P(downbeat)]
pair that sums to <= 1, so the observation model is well-formed and nothing is clamped. (Measured on
our val cache: decorrelating is worth ~+0.06 F vs feeding raw activations -- not optional; the raw
form's log(negative) nan corrupts the whole Viterbi path.) R0 is the literal, correct DBN baseline --
the certificate R1 (our own PyTorch bar-pointer DBN) must reproduce.

This follows the Beat This / Beat Transformer paradigm -- the joint bar-pointer DBN + Boeck
decorrelation that both SOTA systems independently converged on. WaveBeat's separate-tracker approach
is a different model class, considered and NOT adopted (unproven on our data). The two knobs let R0
match each system's exact recipe; per our ablation they are near-equivalent, so the defaults are what
matter:

    input_form : "prob"  activations already in [0,1] (our cache act2)                    [DEFAULT]
                 "logit" raw pre-sigmoid logits (Beat This / Beat Transformer) -> we sigmoid them
    bounding   : "clip"    np.clip(x, eps, 1-eps)          (ours, WaveBeat)                [DEFAULT]
                 "squeeze" x*(1-eps) + eps/2               (Beat This)
                 "none"    no clip (Beat Transformer). For logit input; unsafe on probs with exact 0/1
    eps        : bounds values off 0/1 and floors the decorrelation; 1e-5 (Beat This/ours) is a hair
                 better than 1e-8 (WaveBeat), but its exact value barely matters.

  Beat This        = input_form="logit", bounding="squeeze"
  Beat Transformer = input_form="logit", bounding="none"
  our prob cache   = input_form="prob",  bounding="clip"    (the defaults)

We deliberately leave madmom's OWN defaults untouched, because Beat This and Beat Transformer also
call the processor with them -- so R0-as-published includes all three. They are decode heuristics
wrapped around the DBN, and R1 implements none of them:
    num_tempi=60    a coarser log-spaced tempo grid (vs all 71 integer intervals here)
    threshold=0.05  crop to the main above-threshold segment before decoding
    correct=True    report the activation peak inside a beat region, not the region entry
Measured on our val set they are worth ~+0.006 beat F over the bare model, almost all of it
threshold=0.05 cropping fade-in/fade-out -- which only the Ballroom subset has (74/85 songs; every
other dataset ~0%). correct=True actually costs us -0.0014. So the R1-vs-R0 gap is these heuristics,
not our inference: against a MATCHED madmom, R1 decodes an identical Viterbi path.

fps: REQUIRED and frontend-specific -- a property of the activations, never a global constant, and a
wrong fps mis-scales every DBN tempo. Pass record['fps'] from the cache. Native rates differ by model
(Beat This 50, MERT ~75, WaveBeat 172.27); our cache currently interpolates every frontend up to 86.13
(= 22050/256), so record['fps'] is 86.13 today -- but reading it keeps R0 correct the moment a frontend
is cached at its own native rate.
