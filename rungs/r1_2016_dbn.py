"""R1 -- Baseline A in OUR framework: the Böck 2016 DBN, hand-set factors, our inference.

The same model R0 runs (madmom's DBN), rebuilt on our own code and run through our own DP. THE
CERTIFICATE: if R1 reproduces R0, our inference is validated on a real model and the ladder's anchor
is set -- after which R0 -> R4 is a clean "hand-set vs learned bar-pointer, same inference" axis.
R2+ change ONLY how the factors are produced.

Status: R1 and a matched madmom find the SAME Viterbi path (100% of frames, every song tested) and
score identically to 4 decimals. madmom's DBNDownBeatTrackingProcessor wraps the model in three
deployment heuristics -- num_tempi=60 (a coarser log-spaced tempo grid), threshold=0.05 (crop to the
main above-threshold segment) and correct=True (report the activation peak inside a beat region
rather than the region entry) -- and R1's DEFAULTS now match those shipped values, so out of the
box R1 == R0 event-for-event. They are deployment heuristics, not the model (~+0.006 beat F, almost all
of it threshold=0.05 cropping Ballroom's fade-ins/outs); the BARE model -- what the certificate
pins to a matched madmom and what rung-to-rung comparisons should run -- is the explicit opt-out
num_tempi=None, threshold=0.0, correct=False.

Everything here is HAND-SET; nothing is learned:
  state space : Krebs 2015 -- a tempo of i frames-per-beat owns exactly i states, so the pointer
                advances exactly +1 state per frame (see rungs/bar_pointer/state_space.py for why a uniform
                grid fails). Multi-meter (madmom's default [3, 4]) as in Böck 2016: one bar per
                meter, no cross-meter transitions, best Viterbi score wins (see __init__).
  transition  : deterministic advance inside a beat; madmom's exponential tempo mix at beat
                boundaries, exp(-transition_lambda |ratio - 1|), row-normalized.
  emission    : Böck 2016's mutually-exclusive {no-beat, beat, downbeat} observation model on the
                DECORRELATED activation (max(beat - downbeat, eps), downbeat) -- the same
                decorrelation R0 uses, and required because that model assumes the columns sum to <=1.

Everything is torch (GPU + autograd-ready), which is what R2-R4 need and what madmom cannot give.

        float32 the score accumulated over ~20k frames drifts enough to lose it (measured: 0.12 nats
        worse than madmom on a Beethoven val song -- a strictly suboptimal Viterbi path, which Viterbi is
        not allowed to be). The cost is small: this DP is kernel-launch bound, not compute bound.

        num_tempi / threshold / correct default to madmom's SHIPPED values (60 / 0.05 / True), so a

        Multiple meters replicate madmom's MultiPatternStateSpace exactly: the union HMM is
        block-diagonal with NO cross-meter transitions, so decoding it equals decoding each meter
        separately and keeping the higher-scoring Viterbi path. The one wiring subtlety: madmom's

        constant -log(total states across meters) -- per-meter uniform would bias the comparison
