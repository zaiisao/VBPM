"""Model-independent deployment lessons, shared by every rung.

These are madmom's shipped decode conveniences (DBNDownBeatTrackingProcessor defaults), kept as
OPTIONS because they measurably help deployment F and the lesson should outlive any one rung.
They are ON by default in R1 (matching madmom-as-shipped); rung-to-rung comparisons and the
R1-vs-madmom certificate must opt OUT to the bare model (threshold=0.0, correct=False,
num_tempi=None). Measured contributions (val, 25 songs, {3,4}): threshold +0.005 beat F, peak
snap +0.014 on classical-heavy material (sign flips on tight pop/electronic -- genre-dependent,
not free).
