"""The rung contract: every rung on the ladder is a Rung.

A rung is a deployable beat/downbeat tracker with ONE public entry point:

    predict(features, **predict_options) -> {'beats': seconds[N], 'downbeats': seconds[M]}

so evaluate.py can score every rung identically and rung comparisons are always apples-to-apples.
The base class owns what is common to ALL rungs -- the deployment interface, input coercion and
validation, the Böck 2016 decorrelation, and the empty-result shape -- and leaves the model itself
to the subclass:

    coercion      accept numpy or (possibly CUDA) torch [num_frames, 2] (beat, downbeat), hand the
                  subclass float64 numpy. Validated here so no rung ever sees a malformed input.
    decorrelation max(beat - downbeat, floor) -- the standard convention (Böck, Krebs & Widmer,
                  ISMIR 2016) that converts a modern two-sigmoid frontend (beat fires on downbeats
                  too, so beat + downbeat can reach ~2) into the mutually-exclusive
                  [P(beat-not-downbeat), P(downbeat)] pair the bar-pointer observation model
                  assumes (it computes the no-beat mass as 1 - beat - downbeat). Shared here
                  because EVERY rung that emits through that observation model needs the identical
                  transform -- R0 and R1 using different decorrelations would void the
                  certificate.

The input contract is uniform: activation-consuming rungs receive PROBABILITIES -- whoever calls
predict() converts logits first (the Tracker does it automatically in a pairing; sigmoid is
sigmoid, so where it happens is not a modeling choice). The one genuine frontend-fidelity knob,
`bounding` (clip/squeeze/none -- measured near-equivalent in F but NOT always event-neutral), is a
base constructor parameter wired from the frontend by the Tracker for every activations-mode
pairing. Rung-specific knobs stay in the subclasses (e.g. R1's threshold/correct deployment
options).
